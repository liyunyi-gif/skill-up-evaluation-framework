## Overview

skill-up combines **evaluation** and **evolution** for Agent Skills. It makes quality measurable through declarative YAML evals, isolated multi-engine runs, flexible judges, and structured reports. Then skill-upper turns failures into progress: it can automatically repair or expand the eval suite and rerun the loop with you.

The same workflow runs locally or in CI, supports Anthropic `evals.json` imports, and emits JSON, JUnit, and HTML reports.
