# Getting Started

skill-up is an evaluation and evolution tool for Agent Skill developers. Use it
to verify that your Skill behaves correctly inside real Agent Engines (Claude
Code, Codex, Qoder CLI), turn failures into targeted fixes, and run continuous
regression locally or in CI.

## Eval-to-Evolution with skill-upper

For the best experience, use **skill-upper** — the conversational evolution
driver shipped with this repository. It guides an AI agent to create evals, run
skill-up, diagnose failures, repair the target Skill or its supporting files,
strengthen the eval suite when it finds coverage gaps, and rerun the evaluation.
This turns a single test run into a repeatable evaluate → diagnose → fix →
rerun loop.

### 1. Install the `skill-upper` Agent Skill

Recommended: install it with the `skills` CLI:

```bash
# Codex, global install
npx skills add https://github.com/liyunyi-gif/skill-up-evaluation-framework/tree/main/skills/skill-upper -g -a codex -y

# Claude Code, global install
npx skills add https://github.com/liyunyi-gif/skill-up-evaluation-framework/tree/main/skills/skill-upper -g -a claude-code -y
```

You do not need to install `skill-up` before installing this Skill.
`skill-upper` checks whether the `skill-up` command is available when it runs
and guides the agent through installation if it is missing.

### 2. Create and run the first evals

Open the target Skill project in your AI agent. The target project should have
this shape:

```text
my-skill/
  SKILL.md
```

Then ask the agent something concrete:

```text
Use skill-upper to add evals for this Skill.
Add this evaluation case:
- Input: write a hello world program.
- Evaluation: check that the output contains hello and world.

After that run skill-up to validate and run.
```

The agent should create files like:

```text
my-skill/
  SKILL.md
  evals/
    eval.yaml
    cases/
      basic.yaml
my-skill-workspace/
  iteration-1/
    result.json
```

When `evals/eval.yaml` lives under a directory containing `SKILL.md`,
`skill-up` automatically installs that local Skill for the run, so you usually
do not need to list the Skill path manually in `eval.yaml`.

### 3. Diagnose, fix, and iterate

After the first run, continue the conversation instead of manually interpreting
every report:

```text
Use skill-upper to inspect the latest skill-up results.
Diagnose each failure, fix SKILL.md or its supporting files, and add or refine
eval cases when the suite is missing coverage. Then rerun skill-up.
Continue until the evals pass, or explain what remains blocked.
```

skill-upper uses the structured skill-up results to drive the next change. Each
iteration keeps the Skill implementation and its eval suite aligned, so fixes
become regression coverage rather than one-off patches.

## Manual Installation

### Install with the script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liyunyi-gif/skill-up-evaluation-framework/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the matching binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/liyunyi-gif/skill-up-evaluation-framework/releases).

To build locally from a checkout, install [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.25 or later:

```bash
make build
# or
go build -o bin/skill-up ./cmd/skill-up
```

### Verify the install

```bash
skill-up --version
```

## Core concepts

To evaluate a Skill with skill-up you need two things:

1. **eval.yaml** — the entrypoint config that declares the runtime environment, the Agent Engine and model, and the global grading strategy.
2. **case.yaml** — a single evaluation case that defines the prompt sent to the Agent, the expected output, and grading rules.

They live inside the `evals/` folder of your Skill:

```text
my-skill/
  SKILL.md              # Your Skill definition
  evals/                # Evaluation root
    eval.yaml           # Entrypoint config
    cases/              # One file per case
      basic-test.yaml
      edge-case.yaml
    fixtures/           # Optional test resources
      repos/            # Repository templates
      scripts/          # Grading scripts
```

---

## 5-minute quick start

### Step 1 — Create the eval config

Inside your Skill directory, create `evals/eval.yaml`:

```yaml
schema_version: v1alpha1

environment:
  type: none                    # Plain-text Skills don't need an isolated container

engine:
  name: claude_code             # Use Claude Code as the Agent Engine

cases:
  files:
    - evals/cases/hello-world.yaml
```

> **Tip:** When `evals/eval.yaml` lives under a directory that contains `SKILL.md`, skill-up installs the current Skill automatically. The omitted fields use defaults: JSON report output, `timeout_seconds: 300`, `max_turns: 10`, and `parallelism: 1`. Add `engine.model`, `skills`, `cases.defaults`, or `report` only when you need to override them.

For the full `eval.yaml` schema, see [Writing Evals](./writing-evals).

### Step 2 — Write an Eval Case

Create `evals/cases/hello-world.yaml`:

```yaml
input:
  prompt: |
    Please generate a Hello World program

expect:
  must_contain:
    - "Hello"
    - "World"
  must_not_contain:
    - "error"
```

The case `id` defaults to the filename (`hello-world`). Add a `judge` block only when you need script-based or agent-based grading.

### Step 3 — Validate the config

This step is optional, but useful before the first run: it checks `eval.yaml` and all referenced case files without starting an Agent Engine.

```bash
skill-up validate
```

On success you should see:

```text
✓ eval.yaml is valid (loaded 1 case(s))
```

### Step 4 — Run the evaluation

```bash
skill-up run
```

You will see output similar to:

```text
Running 1 case(s) with agent claude_code
[Runner] Running 1 cases with agent claude_code
[Evaluator] Skill installed: <skill-name>
[Evaluator] Running case hello-world (with_skill): Skill should respond to a basic request
[Evaluator] Case hello-world: PASS (pass_rate: 100.0%)
[INFO] Results written to ./<skill-name>-workspace/iteration-1
```
